			"description": "# Klayr Service API Documentation\n\nKlayr Service is a middleware web application that interacts with the entire Klayr ecosystem in various aspects, such as accessing blockchain data (both on-chain and off-chain information), retrieving and storing market data, and exporting account history.\n\nThe main focus of this project is to provide data to Klayr blockchain users by serving them in a standardized JSON format and exposing a public RESTful API. The project is split into several smaller components (microservices) each focused on serving a single specific purpose. \n\nAs a pure backend project, it is designed to meet the requirements of front-end developers, especially Klayr Desktop and Klayr Mobile.\n\nThe API can be accessed at `https://service.klayr.xyz`.\nIt is also possible to access the Testnet network at `https://testnet-service.klayr.xyz`.\n\nThe Klayr Service API is compatible with RESTful guidelines. The specification below contains numerous examples of how to use the API in practice.\n\n## Endpoint Logic\n\nThe logic of the endpoints are as follows:\n- the structure is always based on `/<root_entity>/<object>/<properties>`\n\n## Responses\n\nAll responses are returned in the JSON format - `application/json`.\n\nEach API request has the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"data\": {}, // Contains the requested data\n  \"meta\": {}, // Contains additional metadata, e.g. the values of `limit` and `offset`\n}\n```\n\nAnd, the error responses adhere to the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": true,\n  \"message\": \"Not found\", // Contains the error message\n}\n```",
